# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Tweety: X Voice Assistant app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Aziz Albahar (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Commercial service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

<br>

## Information Collection and Use

The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as:

- Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)
- The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages
- The time spent on the Application
- The operating system you use on your mobile device

The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.

The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.

For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to userId. The information that the Service Provider requests will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.

<br>

## Voice Data Collection and Processing

The Application records and processes voice audio to provide voice assistant functionality. Here's how we handle your voice data:

- **Voice Recording:** When you use voice commands, the Application records your speech to process your requests
- **Transmission to AI Services:** Voice recordings are transmitted to third-party AI services (Grok by xAI and OpenAI) for real-time speech recognition and natural language processing
- **Purpose:** Voice data is used exclusively to understand and execute your voice commands for controlling your X account
- **Retention:** Voice recordings are not permanently stored by the Service Provider. They are processed in real-time and discarded after processing
- **Third-Party Processing:** Voice data is processed according to the privacy policies of Grok and OpenAI (linked below)
- **Quality:** Audio is streamed with low latency to provide natural, real-time conversations

By using voice features, you consent to the recording and processing of your voice as described above.

<br>

## X (Twitter) Integration

The Application requires authentication with your X (formerly Twitter) account to function. When you connect your X account:

- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication:** We use OAuth 2.0 to securely authenticate with X without accessing your password
- **Data Access:** We access your X profile information, timeline, tweets, and ability to post and interact with content
- **Actions Performed:** The Application can post tweets, reply to tweets, like content, and perform other X actions on your behalf via voice commands
- **Token Storage:** X authentication tokens are stored securely in your device's Keychain using industry-standard encryption
- **Password Security:** We never collect, store, or have access to your X password
- **Data Usage:** Information retrieved from X is used solely to provide voice-controlled functionality and is not shared with third parties except as required for AI processing
- **Revocation:** You can revoke the Application's access to your X account at any time through X's settings or by uninstalling the Application

<br>

## Third Party Access

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

The Application uses the following third-party services that may collect and process your data:

## Use of Artificial Intelligence

The Application uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance user experience and provide voice assistant features. The AI components process the following data:

- **Conversation Flow:** AI maintains conversation context to provide natural, multi-turn interactions

All AI processing is performed in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable laws. The AI does not make autonomous decisions without your voice command or confirmation for sensitive actions.

If you have questions about the AI features or data processing, please contact the Service Provider at aziz@tweetyvoice.app.
